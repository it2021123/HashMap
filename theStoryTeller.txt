I went for vaccation at the same place i go every year and i thought that it was gonna be another same old summer.
But i was so wrong. At that summer the 1st even day i went out for a walk with my brother's and cousins' friends from
a nearby village.And that was the day i met her. She was the most beautiful girl i had ever met. Her eyes, her hair,
her face was so so pretty that i knew right there that i should at least try to persuade her to be with me. So i 
started talking to her as much as i could. I would tease her and be playful with her. We were joking around together, 
swim by each other. I was even trying to convince my brother to take me with him in order to just see her. To be 
truthful, i didn't really thought that she liked me. I just thought it was in her character to just be playful and 
open with the others. Until one day, we were going to the "big" village of the area and we were sitting together at
the back seats. And at a moment,she just touched my hand,and,and i just felt wonderfully, i felt amazingly like that
moment was forever. And from that moment and on, we were trying to be on physical touch always and there were those
moments..those moments we were hugging and i was thinking that all the other things were vanished and that the time 
had stopped. This girl,this woman just made me feel amazing. But,sadly, the summer had come to an end, and i should 
goodbye her, i dropped a tear that moment, not knowing wether i would see again or not that amazing person that just
got in my life.
